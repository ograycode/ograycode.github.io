#7 Apps In 7 Days

It is my goal to create seven useful applications in seven days, while still working fulltime.

##Why?
Why would I do this? I'm doing this for a variety of reasons, to include refocusing my energy on creating useful programs that follow the unix model of small and concise applications that do one thing really well. I think this project is perfect for this exercise as I tend to get caught up in projects that are impossibly big for a single person with tight time constraints.

##When?
I'll start now, right now.
