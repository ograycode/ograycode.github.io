#Undoing the Enterprise

Recently, I was tasked with creating another demo project. The requirements were simple enough, screens had already been mocked up and there wasn't much time until the client wanted to see something. After being tasked with this, I asked what my technical parameters were and to my surprise there was a lot of latitude with them.

###Follow or be followed

At this point, I decided to take a risk and choose the most appropriate technology stack for the job and not what was unofficially blessed. After all, this is a demo right? The whole point is fast iterations, to show off what we can do and win the approvals of those who have the power to approve. 

I choose to use [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) with a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) backend. This combination of technologies gave me the power to rapidly build out the mockups and have them be fully functional with mocked data in a matter of hours -- they thought it would take a week. 

Once done, I showed this to the managers and they got excited. They started thinking through the demo some more, how it would be presented, talking out-loud as I was showing them and making plans to meet about it over lunch. 

After they left, I implemented their key points, creating two new screens for a separate application, creating the models to drive it, hooking up a database, and implementing live data where it was previously mocked. Once they came back from lunch, they told me what they wanted and I went "Oh, is it something like this" and showed them what I had done, and once again they were excited.

Now they are asking probing questions about the technologies used and why I choose them over what has been the blessed stack for nearly a decade. I told them my choice was a simple one, I looked at what they wanted to accomplish and choose the best tools available for what they wanted to do, and the results proved that out.

###This is a case against the Enterprise

If I had gone the blessed path, the estimations would have been correct -- what had taken me less than 6 hours of work would have taken a week, if not more. Earlier in my career I had let the Enterprise tell me how to build and never strayed from the path even when requirements were vague, and while that does have its place, the one size fits all policy employed by most Enterprise's do have consequences. What makes it worse is often times these decisions are made by those far removed from the consequences, and the employee who has to deal with it isn't empowered to choose what is best for the project and the company's goals. 

While what I did was risky for me personally, sometimes those risks need to be taken to show what is possible once the chains of the Enterprise are broken.
