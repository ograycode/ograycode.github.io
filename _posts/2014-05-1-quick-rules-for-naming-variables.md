# Quick Rules for Naming Variables

I've been around the block a few times and have the pleasure of working on some pretty important projects, both on legacy code bases and ones started from scratch, and one of the themes I've run across over and over again is poor variable naming. Accordingly, here is a few rules I've come up with to make them better:

*  No abbreviations, ever.
*  Be as descriptive as possible, I should not have to look at context to figure out what a variable is supposed to be.
*  Use simple words.
*  Don't make up new words.

That's it, really. I think if most engineers followed these simple rules a lot of heartache would be gone. It's amazing to me how often these are broken and while at the time the some name may make sense, who knows if 6 months from now it will at all or if you or the rest of the team can remember what that three letter abrevation stood for.
