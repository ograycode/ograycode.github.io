# Thoughts on AngularJs 2.0  

I have remained fairly silent on this subject as I wanted some time to think it over. I won't lie, my initial reaction was not positive -- almost to the point of feeling betrayed -- but as time has passed and more facts have come in, I am feeling good about the 2.0 transition and here is why:

### Changes  

It is no secret that frameworks change over time, that they get re-written and that it is always a pain to upgrade. That is just how it is and probably how it always will be -- even from firmly Enterprise to the hip new thing, what runs now probably won't run on the same framework in a few years. The only question is how painful will the upgrade be and is it worth it?

How painful will it be? I wasn't at the conference in which AngularJs 2.0 was previewed, and I didn't hear the talk, but the slides gave a first impression that this upgrade will be very painful. It will require major reworking of a lot of code and templates; however, that is only if it is done by hand. That said, the template semantics look very uniform and appear to have direct translations from old to new which makes me believe that either the core team or the community will develop a way to make that transition much easier.

Is it worth it? For many, it just isn't worth the upgrade until security patches stop being released. Sure, we all love to stay on the bleeding edge but unless there is a business case for upgrading it just doesn't happen (most of the time).

### A Fractured Community?  

My primary fear is a fracturing of the community, in the same way that python 2.x to 3.x has fractured that community. The way I see it playing out is either a relatively easy and understandable upgrade path is provided or the community will fracture with those that have the will power and resources upgrading, and those who do not have the need to upgrade staying behind. A fissure like this could lead to some very uneasy times as forks of the 1.x code base compete with each other and commercial offerings come and go.

If not enough people migrate, it could also jeopardize the position that AngularJs has within the developer community and Google's continued support for it.

### So What Next?  

Only time will truly tell, but I am optimistic that the community will get behind AngularJs 2.0 once more information is hammered out (as far as I am aware no code has actually been written yet), and a clear upgrade path will be planned by the time it goes into a stable release.
