#Introducing EsyBoard

My newest project, [EsyBoard](www.esyboard.com), was launched just a few days ago. I created it out of the need to have a free form scratch pad to take notes while working or brainstorming. I tried the traditional methods, but they were all too limiting, so I tried other alternatives and they were either not developed enough or too complicated for my needs.

###Features

It's still in the early days of [EsyBoard](www.esyboard.com), but it has some key features that make it incredibly useful:
*   Saving
*   Forking
*   Freeform text
*   Drawing
*   Importing images and svg's

###Technical side

For those intrested, [Esyboard](www.esyboard.com) is built with NodeJs and hosted on Heroku. For the database, I choose to go with MongoDB because a key-value store is exactly what I needed for this. Finally, the drawing space was build with HTML's canvas using Fabric.js to quickly get the concept into a working product.

###Future

I have a lot of plans for the site, and many many features that I want to add. With time, I may try to monetize the site, but I want to keep it as simple and elegant as possible, as that's what I need. That said, I am already using [EsyBoard](www.esyboard.com) every day, as it's just too valuable a tool to be ignored.
