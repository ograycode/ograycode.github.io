#Becoming a better Engineer by becoming a Father

So it has been a hectic time for me, as I became a father a little over two months ago. It's been a wild ride adding a new little one to the family, but a ride well worth it.

### Focused exploration

I've read a bunch on how becoming a father can change you, for better or worse, professionally. However, what I found was that it in fact has made me a better Engineer overall. I'm no longer chasing every new technology, instead I pick and choose, very carefully, what I invest my time in -- and one of those technologies I've chosen to invest my time in is [Meteor](https://meteor.com).

### Prioritization

I have also learned to prioritize in ways I never thought I could imagine. I finally learned what needs to be done now and what can be done later. Having a little one has given me the ability to see what exactly needs to be done and when. I think this skill will serve me will, both for employers and myself, for the rest of my time.


### Waking up early

I had always considered myself a morning person, but until I had a kid I was never a particularly productive morning person. Now, I wake up when he does, take care of his needs and start my day. I get time to check my email, plan my work day and think over any issues that may have been blocking me. All of this allows me to hit the ground running every time I start a project instead of floundering wondering what to do next. I get more done in the morning than I do all day -- like this blog post.
