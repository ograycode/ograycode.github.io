# Thoughts on Working Remotely 
 
Recently, I've been lucky enough to find a job at a company who values getting things done instead of having warm bodies in a chair. While the rest of my team works from the office usually, I am thousands of miles away and across several time zones. 
 
I've found that working remotely suites me well as I can be removed from distractions of the office and can focus on getting my work done and improving the bottom line. It certainly is not for everyone and there are some trade-offs like missing the spontaneous discussions. 
 
That said, here are some tips I have found to working successfully outside the office: 
 
*  Effective communication though several channels if key. 
*  Do not hesitate to use video chat. 
*  Keep in contact every working day with the rest of your team. 
*  Make your work environment as distraction free as possible. 
*  Break up your day if possible by going to the gym or doing some other non-work related activity. 
*  Work for results, not for time.
