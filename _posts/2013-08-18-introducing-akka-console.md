#Introducing Akka console

I'm pleased to introduce the [Akka Console](/akka-console). It is a simple console that displays an Akka instance's information.

This was inspired by Typesafe's Console, but is open source and under the same license as the akka code. 

Akka is a promising library, with Scala and Java APIs, that creates a light weight framework to build high availability, scalable sytems.

The console is still very early indevelopment, and is aimed at akka clusters.
