### About Me
I'm a full stack software developer in the Washington, D.C. metro area. I build amazing things in my free time when I'm not busy spending it with my lovely wife or friends.

### Experience
I have experience building hybrid mobile applications, large mission-critical enterprise software, pulling off pilot projects with absurd timelines and tackling technically challenging problems in order to make successful products.
